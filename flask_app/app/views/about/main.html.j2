              Over the past two decades, ~23,000 non-pathogenic actinobacterial genomes have been sequenced and made publicly available. We have initiated a large-scale genome sequencing campaign to sequence all actinobacterial strains at NPDC over the next five years, ultimately quintupling the number of actinobacterial genomes currently available.

              NPDC: The actinobacterial strain collection at the Natural Products Discovery Center (NPDC) at UF Scripps currently contains a total of 125,127 strains, of which at least 62,328 are actinobacteria, 14,465 other bacteria, and 48,334 unidentified. These strains were isolated over the last eight decades, with the majority acquired between 1940s to the 2010s. The wide time range of collection has allowed for capture of chemical diversity based on evolution and environmental cues, which change over time and are impossible to reproduce in laboratory settings today. The 62,328 actinobacteria in the collection, spanning at least 88 different genera, were isolated from 69 different countries with different climate and ecology factors that further increase natural product structural diversity.  Although these statistics, as well as taxonomic data, are incomplete, the fraction of the strains whose information is available provides a glimpse into the vast spatial, temporal, and taxonomic diversity of the entire collection.â€‹

          The potential number of natural products awaiting discovery from the actinobacterial strain collection at UF Scripps is immense. Estimated on the assumption of ~30 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) per strain, the ~125K strains in the collection could encode more than 3.75 million BGCs, i.e., the potential of producing more than 3.75 million natural products.  In reference to the ~40,000 natural products that have been isolated from bacteria to date, of which about half (~20,000) are from actinobacteria, the current number of known natural products is only ~1% of this value, leaving millions of compounds to be discovered.  Of course, there will be redundancies with many strains producing the same natural products or structurally similar congeners.  However, these redundancies are unlikely to fundamentally reduce the total number of natural products waiting for discovery.  The estimated 3.75 million BGCs will also serve as an unprecedented treasure trove for enzyme and biocatalyst discovery and synthetic biology applications.
